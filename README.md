# My LaurieWired 2024 Halloween Programming Challenge Submission

I didn't have lots of time, so it's a bit crappy and simple, but that was a fun little challenge.

Happy Halloween!

## The script

[My Python Script](steins_gate_captcha.py) can be compiled with `pyinstaller --onefile --windowed steins_gate_captcha.py`.

The prebuild `steins_gate_captcha.exe` file can be found int the `dist` folder.
